grunt-init-go-main
==================

> Create a Go main program with [grunt-init](http://gruntjs.com/project-scaffolding).

## Installation

If you haven't already done so, install [grunt-init](http://gruntjs.com/project-scaffolding).

Once grunt-init is installed, place this template in your `~/.grunt-init/` directory. It's recommended that you use git to clone this template into that directory, as follows:

```
git clone https://github.com/gedex/grunt-init-go-main.git ~/.grunt-init/go-main
```

## Usage

At the command-line, cd into an empty directory, run this command and follow the prompts.

```
grunt-init go-main
```

*Note that this template will generate files in the current directory, so be sure to change to a new directory first if you don't want to overwrite existing files.*
